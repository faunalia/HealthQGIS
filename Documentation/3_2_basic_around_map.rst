Measure length and areas
---------------------------------------------------------

* **Points**

QGIS is able to measure real distances between given points. Click on the |mActionMeasure| button and then click on the map to start the measurement. Each segment-length as well as the total will be showed up in the measure dialog-window. To stop measuring click your right mouse button.
