Print composer
===============

Map layout creation is a very simple procedure with QGIS. We prepared print layout of some layer of the example project: they are all customizable, but for now just focus on how to get them.
Layout preparation will be developed in the :ref:`print_composer_advanced`.


To access to all the layout we prepared click on the |mActionComposerManager| toolbar button:

.. figure:: img/print_composer_easy_1.png
	:align: center
	:scale: 90%

The small dialog box that will open and it lists all the print layout available. Just select an item and click on **Show**.

.. figure:: img/print_composer_easy_2.png
	:align: center
	:scale: 40%

The **Print composer** window will open and you can see the map ready to be printed. Through the print composer window you have access to a lot of functions, but for now just focus on how to save the layout as image or pdf.

.. note:: if none map is shown just update the layout view clicking first on the grid and then on the **Update item** on the right side of the window.

To save the map click on the |mActionSaveMapAsImage| button to save the layout as image, several formats are available (png, jpg, bmp...) or on the |mActionSaveAsPDF| button to save it as pdf. 
In both cases just choose the path where to save the layout and it will be available on your computer.
